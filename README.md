# Python Implementation of NequIP Model for Energy and Force Prediction

Implemented a NequIP model in Python for energy and force prediction. The model is trained and then integrated with the LAMMPS Molecular Dynamics engine to accelerate simulations of the Toluene molecule.

Key Questions:

Integration: Workout Details on how the NequIP model is combined with LAMMPS.
Setup: Guidance on best practice to setting up simulations in LAMMPS.
Performance: How to evaluate the accuracy of the model.
